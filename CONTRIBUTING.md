## Quick Start

If this is your first time contributing to [DuckDuckHack](http://www.duckduckhack.com), we recommend first going through the [Quick Start Goodie Tutorial](https://duck.co/duckduckhack/goodie_quickstart). 

This tutorial is designed to get you to your first commit very quickly. You will learn how to set up your environment and create a super-simple Goodie Instant Answer.

## Create a New Instant Answer

Once you're comfortable with the workflow and how Goodie's work, we're excited to have you create your own original Instant Answer.

1. Choose an idea

	Bring your own idea, or check out the ideas forum - especially [top voted answer ideas](https://duck.co/ideas/status/3?table_lnKRpLENwO2NUmZUyukQpw_sort=votes).

2. Plan your implementation

	The first step is to research and plan your Instant Answer. Consider [the best way to implement](https://duck.co/duckduckhack/determine_your_instant_answer_type) your idea, and review the [docs and guidelines](https://duck.co/duckduckhack/ddh-intro) that apply.
	
3. Involve us

	Before you start coding, [let us know your plans](mailto:open@duckduckgo.com). By involving us early we can provide guidance and potentially save you a lot of time and effort. Email us at [open@duckduckgo.com](mailto:open@duckduckgo.com) with what idea you're working on and how you're thinking of going about it.

	In addition, we'll promptly set up a [central Instant Answer page](http://www.duck.co/ia) on the community platform so others can know you're working on it and how they can help you.

## Improve an Existing Instant Answer

Another great way to contribute is to improve an existing, live Instant Answer. It's a great way to get further acquainted with Instant Answers, as well as get implementation ideas. Many contributors report completing their first fix within two hours of forking the repository.
