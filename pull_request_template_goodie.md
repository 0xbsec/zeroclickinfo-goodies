# Goodie Pull Request Template

Using this template will help us better understand your Instant Answer and assist you when necessary.  Simply copy and paste the markdown below into the description of your GitHub pull request and complete as appropriate.

**What does your Instant Answer do?**
Return the required amount of water for a specified weight of coffee (in either grams or ounces).


**What problem does your Instant Answer solve (Why is it better than organic links)?**
A lot of sites have the ratio listed but not too many coffee calculators for coffee brewing.


**What is the data source for your Instant Answer? (Provide a link if possible)**
http://www.blackbearcoffee.com/resources/83


**Why did you choose this data source?**
Two reasons:

1.) It's a commonly referenced resource for drip coffee water/coffee ratios
2.) It's the most data complete reference out there.

**Are there any other alternative (better) data sources?**
None that I'm aware of for drip coffee.  There are other brew methods that have different water requirements (that could be a good reason to expand this Goodie or make others for different brew types)


**What are some example queries that trigger this Instant Answer?**
coffee to water, coffee to water ratio (with no weights will return the amount coffee to volume water [maybe should be to a common cup size (6 or 8 oz?)])


**Which communities will this Instant Answer be especially useful for? (gamers, book lovers, etc)**
Sysadmins ;D.  Foodies who are into coffee or general coffee consumers who might be looking to get a little more out of their cup.


**Is this Instant Answer connected to a DuckDuckHack [Instant Answer idea](https://duck.co/ideas)?**
https://duck.co/ideas/idea/4972/coffee-to-water-ratio-calculator

**Which existing Instant Answers will this one supercede/overlap with?**
None


**Are you having any problems? Do you need our help with anything?**
Some of the documentation is somewhat lacking for someone who is new and I may contribute to that to help others.  Fortunately, I had other Goodies to reference for things that didn't have any documentation to infer their usage.

**Where did you hear about DuckDuckHack? (For first time contributors)**
I was looking at employment opportunities out of curiosity and stumbled across your hiring criteria.


**What does the Instant Answer look like? (Provide a screenshot for new or updated Instant Answers)**
