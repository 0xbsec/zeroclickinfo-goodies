# Categories represent sets of triggers that can be
# assigned to templates or individual cheat sheets.
#
# Each category consists of a name, along with a set
# of trigger types (specifically WORD triggers - start,
# end, startend, and any) and the associated triggers.
#
# The only special category is 'default', which should be
# assigned to all template types, and will trigger any cheat
# sheet.
#
# Category syntax:
#
# category_name:
#   trigger_type1:
#     - "trigger1"
#     - "trigger2"
#   trigger_type2:
#     - "trigger3"
#     - "trigger4"
#
# Where "trigger_type" is one of start, end, startend, or any.

# Custom cheat sheet triggers.
#
# Format:
#
# cheat_sheet_id:
#   additional_categories:
#     - "category1",
#     - "category2"
#   triggers:
#     startend:
#       - "some trigger"
#       - "another trigger"
#     any:
#       - "yet another trigger"
#
# 'cheat_sheet_id' MUST match the ID of the cheat sheet you wish
# these changes to apply to.
#
# 'additional_categories' specifies a list of categories, as defined
# in the 'categories' section, and may be omitted.
#
# For the format of 'triggers', please see the comments above
# the 'categories' section. The 'triggers' section may be omitted.
#
# For example, say we had a cheat sheet
# called 'calculus cheat sheet', that presented various formulae for
# working with calculus.
#
# The cheat sheet is contained in the 'calculus.json' file, and has the ID
# 'calculus_cheat_sheet'.
#
# As there is (at the time of writing) no support for a 'math' template type,
# yet it is desirable to trigger on things like 'calculus equations', and
# 'calculus formula sheet', we can use the 'math' category with custom triggers,
# this would be specified like so:
#
# calculus_cheat_sheet:
#   additional_categories:
#     - "math"
#   triggers:
#     startend:
#       - "formula sheet"
#       - "equation sheet"
#
# And now it will be able to trigger on 'calculus equations',
# 'calculus formula sheet', 'equation sheet calculus' etc...
