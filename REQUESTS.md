### Goodie Requests/Ideas

 * spelling corrector. We have spelling now but this would be more an explicit attempt to think of alternatives.
 * rhyming dictionary.
 * Improve "lorem ipsum" http://duckduckgo.com/?q=lorem+ipsum goodie so that it shows different text each time
 * Poker hands/probabilities
 * Javascript character codes
 * More [easter eggs](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=answer+to+the+ultimate+question+of+life+the+universe+and+everything)
 * A cheat sheet for all the goodies!
 * Joke/Sad/Funny -- random joke
 * Fun -- random fun thing (flash game?)
 * From [this thread](https://duck.co/topic/is-it-christmas-zero-click-info) "This would kind of be a fun one. A zero-click box sourced from isitchristmas.com would be hilarious. What say you all?"
 * From [this thread](https://duck.co/topic/zero-click-info-idea-reverse-dns) Reverse DNS
way?
 * capitalize x (including accent chars)
 * accents e -> accented chars with that base char
 * Add generator for Chess960 board.
 * Mimic unix cal command, e.g. cal 1 2012
 * Roman numerals.
 * Ideas here: http://www.soople.com/
 * Moon phases.
 * You have a "binary that" feature, it'd be cool to have the opposite to (binary to normal text).
 * Averages of numbers
 * It would be awesome to have a !net or !subnet or something of the sort, or just a simple match on an ip with a subnet to get all the information one may need from it: mask bits, address range, broadcast id, wildcard mask, # of host addresses, host address range, address space, class, ipv6 translation, subnet owner and location, binary representation, CIDR and dotted representations, etc (though not sure about too much else that you could derive from it)

### Being Worked on
 * BEING WORKED ON em to px converter 
 * BEING WORKED ON Suicide hotline #s.
 * BEING WORKED ON Parsing crontab formats and explaining how they get called in a human readable manner :)
