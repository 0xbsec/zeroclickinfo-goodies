[ERROR] Failure on installation of modules!

This could have several reasons, for first you can just restart this installer,
cause it could be a pure download problem. If this isnt the case, please read
the build.log mentioned on the errors and see if you can fix the problem
yourself. Otherwise, please report the problem via email to use at
open@duckduckgo.com with the build.log attached. If there is no build.log
mentioned, just attach the output you see.
